## 答案

一、选择题
B. Mine
→ 名词性物主代词，= my notebook
B. me
→ 动词 asked 的宾语，用宾格
B. yours
→ = your pen，名词性
A. We
→ 主语，用主格
B. its
→ “它的尾巴”，形容词性物主代词；注意不是 it’s（= it is）
二、填空题
me
Her, his
→ Her answer（形容词性）；his = his answer（名词性）
ours, theirs
→ ours = our idea；theirs = their idea
me
→ 介词 between 后用宾格，“between you and me” 是固定搭配
its, itself
→ its surface（它的表面）；by itself（独自地，反身代词，此处提前铺垫）
